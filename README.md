## Prototype
As a developer, I couldn't help but start developing a working prototype of the game! So here it is :
https://battlenev.pages.dev/

To play de prototype, you'll need to install `metamask`, connect it to the `Goerli` testnet and have some tokens (You can use [this faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/) or [this faucet](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/))
